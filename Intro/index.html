      <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Our group was founded in <strong>2014.</strong> When we just got
           to college, we wanted to stand out. We thought of many ways we could do
           that and the only way that came to miind was to use music to
           redefine engineering. So we formed <strong>MAD</strong> which
           stands for Making A Difference.
